# This file shows how to write various types of quiz questions.
# Consult README.md for more information.

# Each file contains one question normally -- however, here we put the
# questions into a single array, so in this file there is an extra level of
# indentation and a hyphen at the beginning of each question that wouldn't
# normally be in a question file

  # for this single-choice question, the user can choose exactly one option
  type: radio
  choices:
    - surface geometry extraction
    - ray traversal
    - transfer function lookup
    - shading
  answer: surface geometry extraction

# 2.yaml

  # for this multiple-choice question, the user can choose any number of options
