# This file shows how to write various types of quiz questions.
# Consult README.md for more information.

# Each file contains one question normally -- however, here we put the
# questions into a single array, so in this file there is an extra level of
# indentation and a hyphen at the beginning of each question that wouldn't
# normally be in a question file

# 1.yaml

  # for this single-choice question, the user can choose exactly one option
  type: radio
  choices:
    - surface geometry extraction
    - ray traversal
    - transfer function lookup
    - shading

# 2.yaml
- question: Which information could not be read from direct volume rendering of the tornado data set?

  type: checkbox
  choices:
    - velocity magnitude
    - velocity direction
    - vorticity
    - critical point
  resource: Tornado
  light: true
  view: true
  answer: velocity direction, vorticity, critical point

# 3.yaml
- question: Given the two direct volume rendering images below, Which one has a better transfer function applied? Please state at least two reasons.
  # this question is a text question using the Foot data set, the `image` is set to `true` as the reference image is stated in the question.
