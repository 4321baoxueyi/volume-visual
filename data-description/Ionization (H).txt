Name: Ionization (H)

Dimension: (300, 124, 124), downsampled

Variable: H (H mass abundance)

Description: This data set, courtesy of IEEE Visualization 2008 Contest, comes from a simulation that performs 3D radiation hydrodynamical calculations of ionization front instabilities for studying a variety of phenomena in interstellar medium such as the formation of stars.
